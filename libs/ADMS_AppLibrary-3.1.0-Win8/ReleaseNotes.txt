  tracking
  
  
3.0.2

- Screen resolution is now accurately being collected for c#, c++, and HTML5/WinJS platforms
- ADMS_Churn class is now internal.  To use best practices for application lifecycle tracking, 
  call public void ADMS_Measurement.StartSession(); and public void ADMS_Measurement.StopSession(); 
  methods as desired
- Added public double maxSessionLength variable to ADMS_Measurement to allow the user to set a maximum 
  session length for the previous user session.  If the registered session length exceeds the max,
  your max session length will be sent.  Default maxSessionLength is 3600 (seconds)
- Added public double lifecycleSessionTimeout variable to ADMS_Measurement to allow the user to set the 
  maximum amount of time that a user can not have the app active before it triggers a new session on 
  the next launch.  Changed default lifecycleSessionTimeout to 300 (seconds)
- Updated TrackingHelper for clarity
